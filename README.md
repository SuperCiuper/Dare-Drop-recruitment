# Dare Drop recruitment

Repository with solutions for recruitment tasks.

## Task 1:

Using react and redux create an auto-complete input field similar to this https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_autocomplete.asp with user name suggestions from this api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
Submit code on your GitHub profile.
Please clone this repo: https://github.com/piekarskid/autoCompleteBoilerplate
Please don't use any libraries that aren't already listed in package.json.
Note that we're aware there are very simple solutions to the test question using libraries or copying and pasting.
This is not the sort of answer we're looking for.
We would like you to show us code you would use to implement this feature without libraries as if this were a novel problem.
Preferably that code will be relatively elegant and easily maintained.
Give us the link to your code submission completing the test task from the project description. I expect your response to the test to demonstrate: 1) ability to understand and follow directions 2) ability to develop a solution 3) quality of code

 

## Task 2:
Is on https://github.com/piekarskid/jsFunctionExercises. Similarly to task 1, please clone repo and solve sub-tasks right below.

Please send links with solved tasks in response to this email.
